# Amazon-Sales-Data-Analysis(Interactive DashBoard Creation Using Power Bi)

## Problem Statement
Analyze and visualize key aspects of Amazon's sales data including sales performance by product category, customer segment, region, and sales channel. 
Use data analysis and visualization to identify trends, patterns, and insights which can be used to optimize sales strategies and improve profitability..

## Inspiration

Amazon is an American Tech Multi-National Company whose business interests include E-commerce, where they buy and store the inventory, and take care of everything from shipping and pricing to customer service and returns. I've created this dataset so that people can play with this dataset and do a lot of things as mentioned below

## Questions(KPIs
> Total sales, total quantity, total profit and total shipment cost?
> A column chart that shows the total sales by product category?
> A line chart that shows the sales trend over time, with the X-axis displaying month and year, and the Y-axis displaying sales?
> How do the sales and profits of each product category compare across different customer segments?
> How do sales revenue and profit vary across different product categories and sub-categories?
> How does the average discount percentage vary across different product sub-categories?
> How does sales and profit vary by region, state, and city?
> Showing the geographic distribution of customers by state, with states ranked by profit.)

- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used. 
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked. 
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic

## Projects Insights
# Overall Performance:
Top Profitable Sub-Categories: Binders are the most profitable sub-category, generating the highest sum of profit, followed by Copiers and Machines. Accessories appear to be the least profitable among the top 5.
Profit by Category: Technology dominates in terms of the sum of profit, representing a significant 56.65% share. Office Supplies contribute a smaller but still notable 35.28%, while Furniture has the lowest share at 8.09%.
Profit by State: California shows the highest sum of profit among the listed states. Michigan also appears to be quite profitable. Some states, like Texas and Pennsylvania, show negative profit.
# Sales Performance:
Top Sales by State: California leads in terms of total sales, followed by Michigan and then Texas.
Order Distribution by State: California has the highest number of product counts (orders), followed by Texas and New York.
# Key Takeaways:
Focus on Profitable Segments: The business should likely focus on boosting sales of Technology products and Binders, Copiers, and Machines, as they drive the most profit.
Address Underperforming Areas: The negative profit in states like Texas and Pennsylvania warrants investigation. Similarly, the lower profitability of the Furniture category could be examined.
California is a Key Market: California stands out as a strong market in terms of both sales and profit

## Final Conclusion

The sales performance appears robust overall, driven significantly by the Technology category and the state of California. However, the negative profit in Texas despite high sales volume is a critical area that needs immediate attention. Understanding the reasons behind this loss (e.g., high discounts, returns, product costs) is crucial for optimizing profitability. Focusing on the high-profit sub-categories like Binders and replicating successful strategies from profitable states like California and Michigan could further enhance overall financial performance. The consistent order-per-customer ratio might suggest an opportunity to encourage repeat purchases or larger order sizes.
